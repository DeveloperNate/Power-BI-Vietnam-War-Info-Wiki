# Vietnam-War-Info-Wiki
<h1> Report</h1>


Below is an image of a Power BI Dashboard that I created. The data was obtained from Wikipedia using web scrapping. The concept behind the Dashboard was to create a document that would be able to able to give an overview of each battle that occurred during the Vietnam War. This includes :

<ul> 
  <li>The location of the Battle</li>
  <li>A Searchable Timeline </li>
  <li>A Breakdown of Regional and City Battles</li>
  <li>An Account of the Causalities for each Battle </li>
  <li> A Description of each Battle.</li>
  <li> The exact Time of each Battle. </li>
</ul>
