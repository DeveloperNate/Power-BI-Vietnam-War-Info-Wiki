# Vietnam-War-Info-Wiki
<h1> Report</h1>


Below is an image of a Power BI Dashboard that I created. The data was obtained from Wikipedia using web scrapping. The concept behind the Dashboard was to create a document that would be able to able to give an overview of each battle that occurred during the Vietnam War. This includes :

<li> 
  <ul>The location of the Battle</ul>
  <ul>A Searchable Timeline </ul>
  <ul>A Breakdown of Regional and City Battles</ul></ul>
  <ul>An Account of the Causalities for each Battle </ul>
  <ul> A Description of each Battle.</ul>
  <ul> The exact Time of each Battle. </ul>
</li>
